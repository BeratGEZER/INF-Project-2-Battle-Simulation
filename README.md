# INF Project 2: Battle Simulation

## Project Description

Welcome to the Battle Simulation project! This project simulates a battlefield environment with various entities such as transceivers and robots. The simulation involves creating and managing these entities, tracking their states, and handling their interactions over time. It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts and provides a dynamic environment for exploring simulation techniques.

### Key Features

- **Transceivers and Robots**: Create and manage different types of entities with specific attributes and behaviors.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: Utilize classes and inheritance to model the entities and their interactions.
- **Dynamic Simulation**: Update the states of entities over time and track their interactions and statuses.
- **Report Generation**: Generate detailed reports of the current state of the battlefield, including alive and dead robots.

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `project2_bunyamin_berat_gezer_210102002061.py` file.

```bash
python project2_bunyamin_berat_gezer_210102002061.py
